Things to try:
- Code your own auto ack
- Do not put parent nodes on pipe 0. Put them elsewhere
- Look at the state of the board for debugging
- Try with auto ack and no inerrupts with updated base node
- Retry but with smalller BPS and less aggressive retries
- Broadcast the message to everyone
- Change power consumption level
