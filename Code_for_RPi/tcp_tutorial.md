# TCP Tutorial
## Purpose
The purpose of this file is to provide a tutorial on how to use the `socket` library in Python to create a TCP client on a Raspberry Pi (RPi). This client will be able to communicate with a server, such as MATLAB, over a local area network (LAN) or Ethernet connection. This tutorial assumes the user has a basic understanding of Python and the Linux command line, as well as a functioning RPi with SSH or VNC access.
