# TCP Tutorial
## Purpose
The purpose of this file is to provide a tutorial on how to use the `socket` library in Python and the `tcpserver` object in MATLAB to create a TCP client/server interface between a RPi and MATLAB. The communication between the two occurs over a local area network (LAN) or Ethernet connection. This tutorial assumes the user has a basic understanding of Python, MATLAB and the Linux command line, as well as a functioning RPi with SSH or VNC access.
